# Use at your own Risk
This is a Discord selfbot. I do not claim any responsiblity for bans that happen from use of this program

# Closing Notes
I understand that this readme is not as detailed as many would like but I'm unsure of the common issues one would have.
I will update this readme if needed 

I will make Updates or try to add features that the public wants only up until it is no longer fun
