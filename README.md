# MudaeAutoBot
What is Mudae Auto Bot?

it is a python bot that Auto rolls and attempts to snipe kaks and Claims in Mudae

How does it work?

All this bot need to work is your "Discord" usertoken and the channel ID that you want to post in

How Automated is it ?

This is completely automated it doesnt need to take any input after inital set up.
I made it simple where all the variables you need can be edited within the **setting_mudae.json** file
Your able to run MudaeAutoBot and still be able to do normal work on your device

# Features
+ Snipes and claims kak in all Discord servers you are in that has Mudae#0807
+ Kak Value sniping as long as Kak value can be determined (Like Rank , Claim Rank , ## Kakera)
+ Waifu/Husbando Rolling Features that Dynamically grab roll timers
+ Pokeslot Rolling Features that Dynamically grab roll timers
+ Selective Kakera Reaction Snipes Features(Includes: Soulmate Kak sniping Feature)
+ Emoji Reaction Snipes  **Ex:Mudae Events**


+ MultiRolling Support was added !!!! (please note that each channel will open a Background_task and is not True Threading there will be Issues) **Go Overboard at your own risk**

# Optimize the snipes
Typing $settings in your server with mudae should give you the snipe and kaksnipping timers.
Using these values you usually snipes faster than a "Human" user can react 

Please when settings Delays avoid setting 0 as your delay as it might be to fast for mudae
a minimum of 1 second to let mudae register that a character was rolled as is reacted to.

(Keep in mind that changing Delays effect servers across the board not just 1 Server)

# Requirments
*Python installed

--python extras--

+ python std library (comes with your python install)
+ discord.py 


# Use at your own Risk
This is a Discord **selfbot**. I do not claim any responsiblity for bans that happen from use of this program

Even though Discord.py is used to make normal bots and the only difference is the token used (Bot Token, User Token)
This is still a Selfbot 

# Closing Notes
